* Scalable motorbike benchmark

There are scripts to configure a motorbike example with minimal effort.

First decide the size and mesh.  This is configured with the inital blockmesh size:

#+begin_src bash
vi Mesh.slm
#+end_src

Modify the following items as appropriate
```
#SBATCH -J mesh_motorbike
#SBATCH -o logs/mesh_motorbike.o%J
#SBATCH -e logs/mesh_motorbike.e%J
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=36
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-core=1


NX=60
NY=24
NZ=24
```

Here is an example of the sizes of mesh that are created for different values:

|-------+-------+-------+----------|
|   X   |   Y   |   Z   |  MCells  |
|-------+-------+-------+----------|
|    20 |     8 |     8 |     0.35 |
|    60 |    24 |    24 |     5.38 |
|    80 |    32 |    32 |    11.2  |
|    90 |    36 |    36 |    15.5  |
|   100 |    40 |    40 |    20    |
|-------+-------+-------+----------|


It is recommended to keep the same proportions here.

Note: All meshing will be run with 16 procs although you can update if necessary.

Submits a job to SLURM.
#+begin_src bash
sbatch Mesh.slm
#+end_src

Now, you can set up the case for a given number of processes (calling setup again will wipe existing partitions):


#+begin_src bash
vi Setup.slm
#+end_src



#+begin_src bash
./Setup <NPROCS>
#+end_src

This will decompose and run potentialFoam.

Now, all you need to do is solve.  Either run simpleFoam or call:

#+begin_src bash
./Solve <NPROCS>
#+end_src
